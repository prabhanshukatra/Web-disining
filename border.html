    <p class="b">Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is
        a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and
        coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph</p>
